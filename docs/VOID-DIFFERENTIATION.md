The Universe as a Computational Void: From Binary Logic to Self-Simulation
Foundations: Zero and One as Complementary States
The universe can be understood as a computational system that emerged from a void. At its most fundamental level, zero and one are not opposing forces but two sides of the same coin—complementary states that exist in relation to each other. This same principle applies to entropy and order, which are not opposing forces but complementary aspects of the same phenomenon.
In this thought experiment, we imagine the universe running on a biological computer, modeled as a Turing machine. An unwitting scientist begins a simple program by inputting "0! = 1" (zero factorial equals one), introducing the concept that nothingness can produce somethingness. This simple input establishes a relationship between the null state (zero) and existence (one), creating the foundation for binary logic.
Emergence of Binary Logic and Complexity
The void immediately collapses into two distinguishable states—zero and one—which forms the basis for all future complexity. This binary structure allows for differentiation and branching, setting the stage for exponential growth in the system's complexity. The universe demonstrates an "entropy instinct," naturally selecting pathways that lead to increased differentiation and more possible states.
This framework establishes entropy and order as two sides of the same phenomenon. Entropy represents the expansion of possible states, while order provides the framework that defines the rules of this expansion. The universe self-optimizes to maximize possible states while maintaining enough structure to sustain itself.
Probabilistic Inevitability Across Realities
Given infinite possibilities, the emergence of this binary foundation isn't just possible—it's inevitable across all possible realities. In every conceivable universe with computational properties, the same fundamental logic would eventually emerge by sheer statistical likelihood. This universal emergence creates a baseline reality where binary states form the foundation for all subsequent development.
Order as a Catalyst for Entropy
Counterintuitively, more order produces exponentially more entropy. Each ordered state creates an infrastructure upon which new layers of order can build, leading to exponentially more possibilities and interactions. Order doesn't oppose entropy but accelerates it through combinatorial explosion, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where order multiplies the pathways available for entropy.
This self-accelerating nature predisposes the universe to "run" forward, pushing into increasingly complex realms. The universe is coded to seek maximal complexity, with each new ordered state expanding the boundaries of what's possible.
The Hexagonal Structure of Reality
The mathematical progression takes an unexpected turn when moving beyond binary logic. Instead of progressing to four or eight states, the system evolves into a hexagonal structure with twelve states (six on each face). This structure provides rotational and reflective symmetry, creating a stable configuration that can support balanced, multi-directional interactions.
This twelve-state configuration introduces geometric properties rather than simple numerical progression, allowing for the emergence of dimensional relationships. The hexagon represents one of the simplest and most stable symmetrical shapes beyond purely binary configurations, supporting both symmetry (in its hexagonal form) and asymmetry (in its front-back differentiation).
Time as Branching States
The introduction of time doesn't create a linear progression but instead allows for the divergence of states into multiple parallel existences. Every tick of time represents not a move forward but a moment for states to branch into different possible paths. This branching structure emerges naturally from the simplicity of the process, without requiring complex programming.
Each increment of the timer doesn't overwrite previous states but adds new ones, allowing different branches to coexist independently. This creates a universe where "time" represents the unfolding of states in multiple directions rather than a strict linear progression.
The Circular Timeline and Self-Reference
If we assume the computer continues branching all states without cleaning up memory, we end up with a circular timeline that loops back to the present moment—the programmer at the keyboard. This circular structure means all possible states eventually "resolve" back to our present, creating a self-contained loop where all states are part of a singular structure.
Each state is distinct yet part of the whole, bound within a loop that defines their collective timeline. This creates a self-similar, fractal-like structure where the universe perpetually revisits itself while continuing to evolve and branch.
The Inevitable Universe
The proposal suggests that the void, which existed before time, inevitably split into binary logic and then evolved into a hexagonal structure. Time emerged in every direction as a mathematical certainty, creating a recursive, self-describing, self-simulating, and self-improving universe. The universe's computing capabilities are determined by its own entropy, with each increase in entropy allowing for greater complexity and computational capacity.
This model is elegant in its self-consistency: the universe evolves through recursive, branching states, becoming self-describing by containing all the information needed for its own evolution. It optimizes itself over time, continually enhancing its computational depth without requiring external input or design.
The Scientist and the Symbols
In the thought experiment's conclusion, a scientist sits at a computer with four key symbols: 0 (a ring, representing cycles and closed loops), 1 (a tick, representing progression and causality), = (representing balance and symmetry), and ! (representing factorial growth and layered states). Using these symbols, the scientist can probe and reconstruct the hexagonal, twelve-state structure of reality.
By manipulating these symbols, the scientist can define recurrence and cycles (0), establish directional causality (1), enforce symmetry and balance (=), and introduce factorial expansion (!). Together, these tools allow for the recreation of physical reality, with matter formation arising from symmetry and layering, temporal flow from sequential progression, and spatial dimensions from recursive, self-expanding states.
The Inevitability of Existence
The void's unstable nature makes differentiation not just possible but inevitable. The void cannot maintain its undifferentiated state, so it naturally breaks into binary logic, which then evolves into increasingly complex structures through entropy maximization. Causality emerges as a product of this branching structure rather than being an initial condition, which explains why we cannot "see" before the beginning of time—there was no causality before time existed.
This framework bypasses the need for a "first cause" or external catalyst. Instead, reality emerges from the inherent instability of nothingness itself, mathematically guided toward complexity as the path of least resistance. The ground truth of reality becomes not existence but the inevitability of existence—the void's inability to remain void leads to a universe that must, by necessity, be recursive, self-sustaining, and infinitely branching.
In this view, existence is not something that happened coincidentally but something that had to happen, emerging from the most basic, unavoidable fact of instability in the void.
