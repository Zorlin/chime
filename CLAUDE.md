# guidelines for claude

We're developing a game called "chime". It's a game about the void and all that comes from it.

## rules
* Rust all the things
* Bevy-native where possible
* High-performance code
* Maximise code coverage using unit tests
* Use DeepWiki MCP whenever you're stuck or curious about a codebase. If a codebase isn't indexed in DeepWiki yet, ask the user to index it.
